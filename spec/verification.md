> Visual verification process using Playwright MCP, plus a per-use-case checklist.
> Copy the checklist (section 2) for each implemented use case.

## 1. Visual Verification Process

Use the Playwright MCP server to visually verify each use case after implementation.

### Steps

1. **Ensure the application is running**
2. **Navigate to the route** — open the page defined in the use case's UI/Routes section
3. **Walk through the main flow** — perform each step from the use case's Main Flow
4. **Take screenshots** — capture the page state at key interaction points
5. **Check visual appearance:**
   - Layout matches expectations (spacing, alignment, sizing)
   - Typography is readable and consistent
   - Interactive elements are clearly identifiable
   - Responsive behaviour works at common breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)
6. **Record results** — note any visual issues in the per-use-case checklist below
