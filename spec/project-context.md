# Project Context

> High-level context for the project: the problem being solved, who it's for, what's in scope, and what constraints apply.

## 1. Vision

A lightweight, internal Inventory Management application that lets a small warehouse team track products, monitor stock levels, receive inbound shipments, and correct discrepancies — all from a single web interface. The system provides real-time visibility into inventory health through a dashboard with low-stock alerts and recent activity, eliminating spreadsheet-based tracking and reducing stock-out incidents.

## 2. Users

| Role | Description | Permissions |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Warehouse Manager** | Oversees inventory operations, maintains product catalog, resolves stock discrepancies | Full access — manage products, receive stock, adjust stock, view dashboard |
| **Warehouse Staff** | Day-to-day receiving and monitoring | Browse inventory, receive stock, view dashboard |

Both roles authenticate via the login page. Role assignment is managed outside the application (e.g., pre-seeded or admin config).

### Demo Credentials

For each demo account the password is the same as the username (e.g., `admin` / `admin`).

| Username | Password | Role |
|----------|----------|------|
| `admin` | `admin` | Warehouse Manager (ADMIN) |
| `staff` | `staff` | Warehouse Staff (USER) |

The login page includes a button labelled "Forgot password". Clicking it adds a visible hint **directly on the login view** (not as a toast/notification) showing the demo credentials, so users can discover the available accounts without documentation.

## 3. Constraints

- Internal-only application — no public-facing views required
- Single-warehouse deployment (no multi-location support)
- All monetary values in a single currency (no currency conversion)
