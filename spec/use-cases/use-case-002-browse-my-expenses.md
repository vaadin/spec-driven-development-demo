# UC-002: Browse My Expenses

**As an** employee, **I want to** view my submitted expenses and their status **so that** I can track what has been approved, rejected, or is still pending.

**Status:** Pending
**Date:** 2026-03-23

## Main Flow

- I navigate to the "My Expenses" page.
- I see a grid/table listing my expenses with columns: date, category, description, amount, and status.
- The list is sorted by date (most recent first).
- I can filter by status (Pending, Approved, Rejected) and/or date range.
- I see a summary row or section showing the total amount for the current filter.

## Business Rules

| ID | Rule |
|----|------|
