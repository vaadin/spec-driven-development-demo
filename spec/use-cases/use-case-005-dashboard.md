# UC-005: Dashboard

**As an** agent or manager, **I want to** see a summary of ticket metrics **so that** I can understand workload and team performance.

**Status:** Pending
**Date:** 2026-03-23

## Main Flow

- I navigate to the dashboard in the admin area.
- I see summary cards showing: total open tickets, total in-progress tickets, total resolved (today), and total closed (today).
- Below the cards, I see a breakdown table of open tickets grouped by category.
- I also see a breakdown table of open tickets grouped by priority.

## Business Rules

| ID | Rule |
|----|------|
| BR-01 | "Open" count includes tickets with status OPEN. |
| BR-02 | "In Progress" count includes tickets with status IN_PROGRESS. |
| BR-03 | "Resolved today" counts tickets that moved to RESOLVED status today. |
| BR-04 | "Closed today" counts tickets that moved to CLOSED status today. |
| BR-05 | Category and priority breakdowns only count non-closed tickets (OPEN, IN_PROGRESS, RESOLVED). |
