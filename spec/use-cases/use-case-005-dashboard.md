# UC-005: Dashboard

**As a** clinic staff member, **I want to** see a summary dashboard **so that** I can get a quick overview of clinic activity.

**Status:** Pending
**Date:** 2026-03-23

---

## Main Flow

- I log in and navigate to the dashboard (or it is accessible from the navigation).
- I see summary statistics: total number of patients, number of visits today, and number of patients registered this month.
- I see a list of the 10 most recent visits with patient name, date, and reason.
- I see a list of the 5 most recently registered patients with name and registration date.
- I can click on a patient name in either list to navigate to their detail view (UC-003).

## Business Rules

| ID | Rule |
|----|------|
| BR-01 | Statistics are computed from current data, not cached |
| BR-02 | "Visits today" counts visits where date equals today |
| BR-03 | "Patients this month" counts patients created in the current calendar month |
| BR-04 | Recent lists are clickable and navigate to the patient detail view |
