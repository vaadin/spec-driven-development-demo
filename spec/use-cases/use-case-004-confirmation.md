# UC-004: Confirmation

> Display purchase confirmation with ticket details and a unique validation code.

---

**As a** rider, **I want to** see my ticket confirmation with a unique code **so that** I have proof of my purchase.

**Status:** Draft
**Date:** 2026-02-19

---

## Main Flow

- I arrive on the confirmation page after a successful purchase
- I see a confirmation message (e.g., "Purchase Successful!")
- I see the full ticket details: ticket name, transit mode, ticket type, quantity, and total price
- I see the last 4 digits of the card used
- I see the purchase date and time
- I see a prominent UUID confirmation code that serves as my ticket validation/uniqueness identifier
- I can tap a "Buy Another Ticket" button to return to the browse page

## Business Rules

| ID | Rule |
|----|------|
| BR-01 | The UUID confirmation code is generated at purchase time and stored in the PurchaseOrder |
| BR-02 | The confirmation code is displayed prominently as the primary identifier |
| BR-03 | Only the last 4 digits of the credit card are shown |
| BR-04 | The confirmation page is accessible only via a valid purchase — navigating directly without a valid order shows an error or redirects to browse |

- UUID value in monospace font (15px mobile, 18px desktop), bold, full width with word-break

### Details List Card

  - Total (price)
  - Card (last 4 digits, e.g., "**** 1111")
