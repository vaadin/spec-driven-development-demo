# UC-003: Select Seats & Buy Tickets

**As a** moviegoer, **I want to** choose my seats and purchase tickets **so that** I have reserved seats for the show.

**Status:** Implemented
**Date:** 2026-03-18

## Main Flow

- I arrive at the seat selection page for a specific show
- I see the movie title, showtime, and screening room name at the top
- I see a visual seat map showing all seats in the room, laid out in rows
- Available seats are shown in one color, sold seats in another (not clickable)
- I click on available seats to select them (they highlight in a third color)
- I can click a selected seat again to deselect it
- Below the seat map, I see a summary: number of selected seats
- I enter my name and email address
- I click "Purchase" to complete the transaction
- I see a confirmation message with my ticket details
