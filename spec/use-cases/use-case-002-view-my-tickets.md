# UC-002: View My Tickets

**As a** customer, **I want to** see a list of my submitted tickets **so that** I can track their status.

**Status:** Pending
**Date:** 2026-03-23

---

## Main Flow

- I navigate to "My Tickets".
- I see a list of all tickets I have submitted, sorted by most recently updated.
- Each ticket shows: title, category, priority, status, and created date.
- I can filter the list by status.
- I click on a ticket to see its full details and comment history.
- On the detail view I see the ticket fields, current status, and a chronological list of comments.

## Business Rules

| BR-02 | The list defaults to showing all statuses. |
| BR-03 | Tickets are sorted by updated date, newest first. |
| BR-04 | Customers cannot change ticket status or assignment. |
