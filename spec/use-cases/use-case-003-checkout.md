# UC-003: Checkout

> Review order summary and enter credit card information to complete the purchase.

---

**As a** rider, **I want to** review my order and enter my payment details **so that** I can complete my ticket purchase.

**Status:** Draft
**Date:** 2026-02-19

---

## Main Flow

- I arrive on the checkout page after selecting a ticket and quantity
- I see an order summary showing: ticket name, transit mode, ticket type, quantity, unit price, and total price
- Below the summary, I see a credit card form with fields for cardholder name, card number, expiration date, and CVV
- I fill in all four fields
- I tap "Purchase" to complete the transaction
- The system simulates the payment (no real processing), creates a PurchaseOrder record with a UUID confirmation code, and navigates me to the confirmation page

## UI / Routes

> **Design references:** [`Screen3.png`](../../design/screenshots/mobile/Screen3.png) (mobile), [`Screen3-desktop.png`](../../design/screenshots/desktop/Screen3-desktop.png) (desktop), [`design-system.md`](../../design/design-system.md) §5.7–5.8, §6.3. Shared rules: [`design.md`](../design.md).

### Back Navigation

- "← Back to Details" link at top of page (amber text, no background)

### Page Title

- "Checkout" heading (page title style)

### Order Summary Card

- Section header: "ORDER SUMMARY" (uppercase, muted, small text with letter-spacing)
- Ticket name and subtitle line (e.g., "Bus · Single Ride · Qty: 1")
- Unit price row
- Total price in amber (large, bold)

### Payment Form Card

- Section header: "PAYMENT DETAILS" (uppercase, muted, small text with letter-spacing)
- Fields (each with label above input):
  - Cardholder Name (full width)
  - Card Number (full width, formatted with spaces as groups of 4)
  - Expiration (MM/YY) and CVV — side-by-side in a single row
- "Purchase" button — primary button (amber gradient, black text, full-width), disabled (reduced opacity) until all fields pass validation

### Responsive Layout

- **Mobile/Tablet:** Single column — order summary card on top, payment form card below
- **Desktop:** 2-panel layout — payment form on the left (1fr), order summary on the right (400px fixed) with sticky positioning so the summary stays visible while scrolling the form
- Note: column order swaps between mobile and desktop — summary is first on mobile but moves to the right sidebar on desktop
