# UC-002: Ticket Detail

> View ticket details and select the number of tickets to purchase.

---

**As a** rider, **I want to** see the details of a ticket and choose how many to buy **so that** I can proceed to checkout with the right quantity.

**Status:** Draft
**Date:** 2026-02-19

## Main Flow

- I arrive on the detail page after tapping a ticket card on the browse page
- I see the ticket name, transit mode, ticket type, a description, and the unit price
- I see a quantity selector defaulting to 1
- I adjust the quantity (e.g., increase to 3)
- I see the subtotal update in real time (quantity × unit price)
- I tap a "Continue to Checkout" button to proceed to the summary/payment page
