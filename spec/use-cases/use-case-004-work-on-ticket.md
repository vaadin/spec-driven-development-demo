# UC-004: Work on a Ticket

**As an** agent, **I want to** view ticket details, add comments, and change status **so that** I can resolve customer issues.

**Status:** Pending
**Date:** 2026-03-23

---

## Main Flow

- I click on a ticket from the queue to open its detail view.
- I see the full ticket information: title, description, category, priority, status, created by, assigned to, and dates.
- I see a chronological list of all comments on the ticket.
- I type a comment in the text area and click "Add Comment". The comment appears in the list with my name and timestamp.
- I change the ticket status using a dropdown (e.g., OPEN → IN_PROGRESS).
- The status updates immediately and is reflected in the queue.

## Business Rules

| ID | Rule |
|----|------|
| BR-01 | Only agents (ADMIN role) can change ticket status. |
| BR-02 | Only agents can add comments. |
| BR-03 | Status transitions follow the allowed flow: OPEN → IN_PROGRESS → RESOLVED → CLOSED, plus RESOLVED → OPEN (reopen). |
| BR-04 | CLOSED is a terminal state — no further status changes allowed. |
| BR-05 | Comments cannot be empty. |
| BR-06 | Comments are immutable once created — no editing or deleting. |
| BR-07 | Changing status to IN_PROGRESS automatically assigns the ticket to the current agent if unassigned. |
