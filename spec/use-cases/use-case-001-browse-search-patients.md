# UC-001: Browse & Search Patients

**As a** clinic staff member, **I want to** browse and search the patient list **so that** I can quickly find the patient I need.

**Status:** Pending
**Date:** 2026-03-23

## Main Flow

- I log in and land on the patient list view.
- I see a table of patients showing name, date of birth, phone number, and email.
- I type into a search field at the top of the table to filter patients by name or date of birth.
- The table updates as I type, showing only matching patients.
- I click a row to navigate to that patient's detail view (UC-003).

## Business Rules

| ID | Rule |
|----|------|
| BR-01 | The patient list is sorted alphabetically by last name by default |
| BR-02 | Search matches against first name, last name, and date of birth |
| BR-03 | The table uses lazy loading / pagination for large datasets |
| BR-04 | An empty search field shows all patients |

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Typing in the search field filters the list in real time
