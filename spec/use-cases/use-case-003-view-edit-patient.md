# UC-003: View & Edit Patient Details

**As a** clinic staff member, **I want to** view and edit a patient's details **so that** I can keep their information accurate and up to date.

**Status:** Pending
**Date:** 2026-03-23

---

## Main Flow

- I click a patient row on the patient list (UC-001) and am navigated to the detail view.
- I see all patient information displayed in a read-only form.
- I click an "Edit" button to switch the form to editable mode.
- I modify one or more fields and click "Save".
- The system validates the input and saves the changes.
- I see a success notification and the form returns to read-only mode.
- Below the patient details, I see a list of the patient's visits (UC-004).

## Business Rules

| ID | Rule |
|----|------|
| BR-01 | The same validation rules from UC-002 apply when editing |
| BR-02 | The patient's visit history is displayed below the details, sorted by date descending |
| BR-03 | Navigating to a non-existent patient ID shows a "Patient not found" message |
