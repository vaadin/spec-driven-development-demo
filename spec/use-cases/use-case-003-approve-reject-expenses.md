# UC-003: Approve or Reject Expenses

**As a** manager, **I want to** review pending expenses and approve or reject them **so that** employees can be reimbursed promptly and invalid expenses are caught.

**Status:** Pending
**Date:** 2026-03-23

---

## Main Flow

- I navigate to the "Review Expenses" page.
- I see a grid of all pending expenses with columns: employee name, date, category, description, amount, and receipt indicator.
- I select an expense to review its details, including the receipt image if attached.
- I click "Approve" or "Reject".
- If rejecting, I enter a comment explaining the reason.
- The system updates the expense status and shows a confirmation.
- The expense disappears from the pending list.
