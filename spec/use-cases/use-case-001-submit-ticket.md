# UC-001: Submit a Ticket

**As a** customer, **I want to** submit a support ticket **so that** I can get help with my issue.

**Status:** Pending
**Date:** 2026-03-23

---

## Main Flow

- I navigate to the ticket submission page.
- I see a form with fields: title, category (dropdown), priority (dropdown), and description (text area).
- I fill in all fields and click "Submit".
- The system creates the ticket with status `OPEN` and shows a success notification with the ticket number.
- I am redirected to my tickets list where the new ticket appears at the top.

## Business Rules

| BR-01 | Title and description are mandatory. |
| BR-02 | Category must be one of: General, Technical, Billing, Access. |
| BR-03 | Priority must be one of: Low, Medium, High, Critical. |
| BR-04 | Priority defaults to Medium if not explicitly chosen. |
| BR-05 | The ticket's `createdBy` is automatically set to the logged-in user. |
| BR-06 | New tickets always start with status `OPEN`. |
